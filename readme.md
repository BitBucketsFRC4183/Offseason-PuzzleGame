# SokobanBuckets
Let's make a puzzle game to learn java principles!

## The Goal
![Goal](./goal.gif)

High-Level
- Player should be able to push boxes by moving into them
- Game should be won if the player moves all the boxes onto the goals

Low-Level
- Code should not repeat itself and should make use of classes and methods

## Instructions
- put stuff here

## How to run the game
- Go to the tab that says Gradle on the upper right sidebar in IntelliJ
- Open the list labelled "desktop", it should be at the bottom
- Open the list labelled "Run Configurations"
- Double click the configuration labelled "Sokoban:desktop [run]"


### New Terminology Involved
- LWJGL: Lightweight Java Game Library
- gdx: The game engine we are using

### Files
./build.gradle
- This is the file that contains the script that manages compiling the code

./assets
- This is the folder that holds the assets

./core/SokobanGame.java
- This is where your game code goes - Similar to Robot.java

./core/systems
- This is where your logic systems should go (will be explained later)
