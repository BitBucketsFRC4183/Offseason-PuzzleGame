### Files
- **/build.gradle**
  - This is the file that contains the script that manages compiling the code
- **/assets**
  - This is the folder that holds the assets
- **/core**
  - This is where the built in starter code goes [write more later pls]
- **/core/TutorialPuzzleGame.java** *[You code here!]*
  - This is the main class of the project
    - Your code branches out from here
  - If this were a robotics project this would be Robot.java
- **/core/solution** *[You code here!]*
  - This is where your code goes!
  - You can write subsystems here, etc
